# 📚 Minimal Library Management System

A minimal yet fully functional library management system built using **React**, **TypeScript**, **Redux Toolkit Query**, and **Node.js/Express** with **MongoDB**. This project demonstrates core CRUD operations, borrowing functionality, and proper API state management—all without user authentication.

> ⚠️ No payment gateways, user login, or category filters are included. This system focuses purely on book and borrow functionality for demonstration or internal use.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

- **MongoDB not connecting?**  
  Check if your `MONGODB_URI` is correct and MongoDB is running locally or remotely.

- **RTK Query not fetching data?**  
  Ensure the backend is running and CORS is properly configured.

- **Form validations not working?**  
  Ensure correct types and constraints are used in the form fields.
